# Prefer Modal Classes for stateful operations

**Description:**

Use `modal.cls` with `@modal.enter` for operations that require loading models or setting up resources once per container startup, improving efficiency for inference endpoints.

**Advice:**

- Load models within the `@modal.enter` method to avoid reloading on every function call.
- Store the loaded model or resources on `self`.
- Define inference logic in `@modal.method`.
