# Be mindful of path formats in WSL

**Description:**

When interacting with the filesystem, especially when passing paths between Windows and the WSL/Ubuntu environment (e.g., in Modal configurations or scripts), be cautious about path separators (`\` vs `/`) and drive mounting (`/mnt/c/`).

**Advice:**

- Prefer using `pathlib.Path` in Python for OS-agnostic path manipulation.
- When defining paths for Modal mounts or configurations that might originate from Windows, ensure they are correctly formatted for the Linux environment inside Modal containers.
